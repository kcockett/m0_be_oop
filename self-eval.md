# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?  Great exercise, no problems
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?  Good, I took a couple of breaks during this one
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?  Classes are much more complicated with required elements that I need to remember
